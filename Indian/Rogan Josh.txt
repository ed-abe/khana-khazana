Chicken Rogan Josh

Ingredients:
5 tablespoon ghee
2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon fennel seeds powder
2 tablespoon garam masala powder
2 red chilli
salt as required
1 pinch asafoetida
3 pinches black pepper
1 teaspoon dried ginger powder
750 gm chopped chicken breasts
2 teaspoon red chilli powder
1/2 cup yoghurt (curd)
1 piece cinnamon stick


Recipe:
Step 1
Heat ghee in a deep-bottomed pan over moderate flame. Add the whole spices and stir fry till fragrant.

Step 2
Now add the chicken pieces and cook covered for 5 minutes. Make sure that it is being cooked on moderate flame. Now whisk the yoghurt and add in the chicken.

Step 3
Add the powdered spices and cook till the moisture is absorbed. Keep the flame high as the chicken cooks fast and would get crumbly if left covered for long. 
Fry till the oil separates. Add a cup of water and allow it to simmer. Check the salt and seasoning.

Step 4
Add more red chilli powder and salt if you feel the need. Remove from fire and garnish as per your choice. Serve hot with naan and steaming rice.
